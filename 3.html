  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <p>
    JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) 
    programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known 
    as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use 
    it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a 
    prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, 
    supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional 
    programming) styles.
    JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, 
    variable parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation 
    (via eval), object introspection (via for...in and Object utilities), 
    and source-code recovery (JavaScript functions store their source text and 
    can be retrieved through toString()).
    This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts 
    that are specific to Web pages or other host environments. For information 
    about APIs that are specific to Web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM.
    The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification 
    (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript Internationalization API specification (ECMA-402).
    As soon as one browser implements a feature, we try to document it. 
    This means that cases where some proposals for new ECMAScript features have 
    already been implemented in browsers, documentation and examples in MDN 
    articles may use some of those new features. Most of the time, this happens 
    between the stages 3 and 4, and is usually before the spec is officially 
    published.
    Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language â€” 
    JavaScript is not "Interpreted Java". Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are 
    trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. 
    However, the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantics, 
    and use.
