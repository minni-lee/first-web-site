  <p>
    The World Wide Web—commonly referred to as WWW, W3, or the Web—is a system 
    of interconnected public webpages accessible through the Internet. 
    The Web is not the same as the Internet: the Web is one of many applications 
    built on top of the Internet.
    Tim Berners-Lee proposed the architecture of what became known as the World Wide
     Web. He created the first web server, web browser, and webpage on his computer
     at the CERN physics research lab in 1990. In 1991, he announced his creation 
     on the alt.hypertext newsgroup, marking the moment the Web was first made 
     public.
